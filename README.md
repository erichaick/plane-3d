# Plane Game - UFO Defense

A 3D browser-based game where players control a plane to defend a city from invading UFOs.

## Requirements

- 3D environment with a city landscape
- Controllable airplane that can fly around the environment
- Enemy UFOs that hover over the city
- Shooting mechanics to destroy UFOs
- Collision detection
- Basic physics for flight controls
- Sound effects and background music
- Game states (start, play, victory, lose)
- Score tracking

## Tech Stack

- **Three.js** - 3D rendering library
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Core programming language
- **HTML5/CSS3** - Structure and styling
- **Howler.js** - Audio library for sound effects and music
- **Webpack** - Module bundler

## Milestones

### 1. Create Plane Model
- Set up basic Three.js environment
- Create or import a 3D plane model
- Implement basic camera following the plane
- Set up lighting for the scene

### 2. Build City Environment
- Create or import city buildings
- Design terrain/ground
- Add skybox
- Implement basic environment lighting

### 3. Set Up Plane Controls
- Implement keyboard/mouse controls for the plane
- Add basic physics for realistic flight
- Create boundaries for the play area
- Implement camera controls that follow the plane

### 4. Add UFOs, Shooting, and Explosions
- Create or import UFO models
- Implement UFO hovering behavior
- Add shooting mechanics from the plane
- Create explosion effects when UFOs are hit
- Implement collision detection
- Add scoring system

### 5. Add Polish and Game States
- Implement start screen
- Create victory and lose conditions and screens
- Add background music
- Implement sound effects for shooting, explosions, and flying
- Add visual effects (particle systems, trails)
- Final balancing and polish
